## Description

A flexible data manager component that utilizes many of the data
components to build a complete paginated display of data as well as tools for
creating, editing, and deleting data.

In addition to the components used, this component provides functionality to
create, update, display, and delete any type of data.

Each data-admin consists of several partial templates which can easily be replaced
to allow developers to customize any part of the data administration interface
while utilizing the functionality of the data-admin viewmodel.

## The View Property

The [view](data-admin__ViewMap.html) is the core property to the
data-admin which controls exactly how the data-admin displays
and updates the data.

### Connection

The view requires a property, `connection` which is the data model. All data displayed in the data-admin is retrieved via the connection and any edits or deletes are pushed back to the connection. The `connection` object is simply a `can-connect`
object, like a supermap.

The other properties define how new data is created, edited, and displayed.

### Fields

Customizing the display of each field can be done via the `view.fields` property.
This property can be a simple array of strings or more complex objects describing
how to format, filter, and display each field.

### New Object Template

To create new objects, the `view.ObjectTemplate` property must be provided.
This is a `can.Map` or similar object. It defines the default values
and the types of properties. The data-admin supports the use of the define
plugin to enable this functionality.

**Note: If the `fields` property is not defined, `ObjectTemplate` is required.
The data-admin falls back on this property to create fields.**

### Related Data

This component is recursive and can display child data-admins on related data
types. The property `view.relatedViews` which contains child views and information
on how the views are related allows for this.
